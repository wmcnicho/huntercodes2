                        <Typography>I have been obsessed with computers and technology for longer than my working memory. This vice led me to pursue a join bachelor-master degree in Computer Science at University of Southern California ‚úåÔ∏è.<br/><br/></Typography>
                        <Typography>After graduating, I worked at Apple as a software engineer on Siri. I worked on a cross-platform team and developed server-side frameworks, mobile frameworks, and just about everything in between. A very scary stack of NDAs make this experience hard describe in detail, but I can say that I have become intimately familiar with GUS architectures and the challenges in building these systems at scale.<br/><br/></Typography>
                        <Typography>In 2019, I relocated from the Bay Area to New York where I continue to get lost in the subway systems and remind myself what seasons are. Here I started HunterCodes and have worked with small businesses and startups to bring their ideas online. I mostly do web related builds so you could call me a full-stack engineer but I work in offline environments as well.<br/><br/></Typography>
                        <Typography>One year later, I started teaching a course on teach Artificial Intelligence at City College of New York. I love to teach and doing so has reignited my passion for computer science. If you are a prospective student you can take a gander at the syllabus and assignments from a previous semester. I am now aspiring to go back into academics and get a PhD in Computer Science.<br/><br/></Typography>
                        <Typography>In my free time, I teach neural networks to be better than me at video games, take Japanese lessons, and obediently tend to the whims of two cats. üòº</Typography>
