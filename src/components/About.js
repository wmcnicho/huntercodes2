                        <Typography>I have been obsessed with computers and technology for longer than my working memory. This vice led me to complete a joint bachelor-master Computer Science program in 2016 at University of Southern California ‚úåÔ∏è.<br/><br/></Typography>
                        <Typography>After graduating, I worked at Apple as a software engineer on Siri. I was on a cross-platform team where I developed server-side frameworks, mobile frameworks, and just about everything in between. A very scary stack of NDAs makes this experience hard describe in detail, but I can say that I have become intimately familiar with <Link href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/acvogel/gus.pdf">GUS architectures</Link> and the challenges in building these systems at scale.<br/><br/></Typography>
                        <Typography>In 2019, I relocated from the Bay Area to New York where I continue to get lost in the subway systems and remind myself what seasons are. Here I started HunterCodes where I work with small businesses and startups to bring their ideas online. I mostly do web related builds so you could call me a full-stack engineer but I work in offline environments as well.<br/><br/></Typography>
                        <Typography> One year later, I developed and began teaching a course on artificial intelligence at City College of New York. I love to teach and <Link href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2689331">some of my students like it too</Link>! If you are a prospective student you can take a gander at the <Link href={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/files/cs44800_syllabus_fall_public_pdf.pdf'}>syllabus</Link> and <Link href="https://hmcnich.gitbook.io/csc448-f21/">assignments</Link> from a previous semester.<br/><br/></Typography>
                        <Typography>Teaching has reignited my passion for computer science, and I aspire to go back into academics and contribute to the field through a PhD program. Inspired by my time working on Siri, my research interests broadly lie in natural language processing (NLP) and human-robot interaction. Within the field of NLP,  I am interested in natural language understanding, generative tasks and conversational modeling. Specifically, I am intrigued by how advancements in these areas can be leveraged to create more sophisticated chatbots and dialog systems.<br/><br/></Typography>
                        <Typography>In my free time, I teach neural networks to be better than me at video games, take Japanese lessons, and obediently tend to the whims of two cats. üòº</Typography>
